```


### Introduction

I made a separate markdown document so that I didn't have to wait 3 minutes every time I wanted to load my knitted document.

### Exercise 10

```{r load-data}
uoe_art <- read_csv("data/uoe-art.csv")
```

```{r separate-title-date, error = TRUE}
uoe_art <- uoe_art %>%
  separate(title, into = c("title", "date"), sep = "\\(") %>%
  mutate(year = str_remove(date, "\\)") %>% as.numeric()) %>%
  select(title, name, year, link)
```

Yes we have some warnings, because some titles don't have a year in parenthesis! As a result, we will have an NA in quite a few rows for the year column.
